# README

Hello Sir this is the work of Dheeraj and Benna.
You 'll find two folders containing each esp and node red flow in the github page.
And one common app.py file that contains the script for this work.
We tried to follow the assignement as close as possible, for the led strip we chose only one light to stay colored for the disponibility.
The important thing is that we managed to get to send the data to the esp with mqtt on it's own topic, so the esp check two topics piscine for the other esps data and the new topic for the grant, this may cause a delay before the new topic data arrives to the esp.
The new topic is uca/iot/piscinepublish35.
